                    I'm a passionate and self-driven creator with a strong background in web development, data science and video editing. 
                    While currently studying Computer Science, I’ve found my true interests lie in building impactful software and digital experiences. 
                    I’m actively developing my skills in web development, data analysis, and creative storytelling, with the goal of breaking into the software industry this year. 
                    Beyond coding, I have a deep appreciation for filmmaking, 
                    commentary-style storytelling, and architecture. My work is a blend of technical problem-solving and artistic creativity, and I thrive on bringing ideas to life through digital mediums.
